# Supplier Module Fix Summary

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**CodeIgniter Version**: 4.6.3 (PHP 8.3)

---

## Summary

Successfully fixed the Supplier module to implement soft delete (archive) functionality with restore and purge capabilities, similar to the Item module.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. SupplierModel.php - Archive Helper Methods

Added the following methods to handle archive operations:

#### `archive($id): bool`
- Sets `status_hps='1'` and `deleted_at=now()`
- Used for archiving suppliers

#### `restore($id): bool`
- Sets `status_hps='0'` and `deleted_at=null`
- Used for restoring archived suppliers

#### `purge($id): bool`
- Permanently deletes supplier from database
- Used for hard delete operation

#### `countArchived(): int`
- Returns count of archived suppliers
- Uses OR logic: `status_hps='1' OR deleted_at IS NOT NULL`

---

### 2. Supplier.php Controller - Updated Methods

#### Updated `delete()` Method
- **Before**: Updated `status_hps='1'` directly
- **After**: Calls `archive()` method which sets both `status_hps='1'` and `deleted_at`
- Message changed to "diarsipkan" instead of "dihapus"

#### New `restore($id)` Method
- Restores archived suppliers
- Uses `withDeleted()` to find the supplier
- Calls `restore()` method to reset `status_hps='0'` and `deleted_at=null`
- Redirects back to trash view

#### New `deletePermanent($id)` Method
- Permanently deletes supplier from database
- Uses `withDeleted()` to find the supplier
- Calls `purge()` method for hard delete
- Redirects back to trash view

#### Updated `trash()` Method
- Uses `withDeleted()` to include soft-deleted items
- Filters for `status_hps='1' OR deleted_at IS NOT NULL`
- Orders by `deleted_at DESC` to show recently archived first
- Uses `countArchived()` for trash count

---

### 3. Routes Configuration

Added new routes in `app/Config/Routes.php`:

```php
$routes->get('supplier/restore/(:num)', 'Supplier::restore/$1');
$routes->get('supplier/delete_permanent/(:num)', 'Supplier::deletePermanent/$1');
```

---

## How It Works

### Archive Flow (Delete)
1. User clicks "Delete" button on a supplier
2. `delete()` method is called
3. Uses `archive()` method to set `status_hps='1'` and `deleted_at=now()`
4. Supplier disappears from main list
5. Supplier appears in trash view

### Restore Flow
1. User views trash page (`/master/supplier/trash`)
2. User clicks "Restore" button
3. `restore()` method is called
4. Uses `restore()` method to set `status_hps='0'` and `deleted_at=null`
5. Supplier reappears in main list

### Permanent Delete Flow
1. User views trash page
2. User clicks "Delete Permanent" button
3. `deletePermanent()` method is called
4. Uses `purge()` method for hard delete
5. Supplier is permanently removed from database

---

## Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Update Method Fixed
- Update form now redirects to supplier list (not dashboard)
- Uses `redirect()->to(base_url('master/supplier'))`
- Shows success message

### ✅ 2. Soft Delete (Archive)
- Delete button now archives suppliers
- Sets `status_hps='1'` and `deleted_at`
- Suppliers not permanently deleted

### ✅ 3. Trash View
- Shows all archived suppliers
- Filters by `status_hps='1' OR deleted_at IS NOT NULL`
- Search functionality works
- Shows recently archived first

### ✅ 4. Restore Functionality
- Restore button available in trash view
- Resets `status_hps='0'` and `deleted_at=null`
- Supplier returns to main list

### ✅ 5. Purge Functionality
- Permanent delete button available in trash view
- Permanently removes supplier from database
- Cannot be undone

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/Models/SupplierModel.php` - Added archive/restore/purge/countArchived methods
2. ✅ `app/Controllers/Master/Supplier.php` - Updated delete, added restore/deletePermanent, fixed trash
3. ✅ `app/Config/Routes.php` - Added restore and delete_permanent routes

---

## Database Schema

The `tbl_m_supplier` table already has the required fields:

```sql
status_hps ENUM('0','1') DEFAULT '0'  -- 0=active, 1=archived
deleted_at DATETIME NULL                -- Archive timestamp
```

Migration: `2025_01_18_000001_create_tbl_m_supplier.php`
